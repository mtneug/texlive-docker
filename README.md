Build LaTeX documents in Docker containers. This

## Usage

This image assumes that you mount your files at `/doc`. By default it will
compile the file called `main.tex`. You can change that by passing some flags:

```
Usage: build.sh [OPTIONS]

Options:

  -f, --file [FILE]     Name of the tex file without file ending (default: 'main')
  -b, --bibtex          Run bibtex
  -g, --glossaries      Run makeglossaries
  -w, --watch           Watch for changes
      --ignore-errors   Continue watching even if an error occurred
  -t, --texmf [PATH]    Custom texmf folder path
  -i, --init [FILE]     Name of the font to be initialized
  -h, --help            Print usage
```

This image also has a watch mode, where it will run a build on every file
change. Assuming you are in your project directory, you might run the following
command:

```sh
$ docker run --rm -v $PWD:/doc mtneug/texlive -b -g -w --ignore-errors
```

This image comes with the possiblity to provide your own texmf folder with additional fonts etc. You can use it like this:

```sh
$ docker run --rm -v $PWD:/doc mtneug/texlive -f beamer -t texmf -i Font.map -b
```
